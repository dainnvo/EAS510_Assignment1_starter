# EAS 510 - Assignment 1: Digital Forensics Apprentice

A rule-based expert system that matches modified images back to their originals.

This is the **starter repository** for Project 1. Two repositories matter:

| Repository | Role |
|------------|------|
| `delveccj/EAS510_Assignment1_starter` (this repo) | Your **code** lives here. You will fork it, work in your fork, and push your final submission here. |
| `delveccj/EAS510_Assignment1` | The **dataset** (read-only). Clone it for the images; never commit it to your fork. |

## Setup on your Codio box

```bash
# 1. Fork this repo on GitHub, then in your box:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/EAS510_Assignment1_starter.git
cd EAS510_Assignment1_starter

# 2. Clone the read-only dataset as a sibling folder (images live there):
cd ~/workspace
git clone https://github.com/delveccj/EAS510_Assignment1.git

# 3. Install dependencies:
cd ~/workspace/EAS510_Assignment1_starter
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Point this box at YOUR fork (run once):
./setup_git.sh
```

## Repository layout

```
forensics_detective.py   SimpleDetector: register targets + find_best_match
rules.py                 Rule functions (Rule 1: Metadata, Rule 2: Histogram, Rule 3: Template)
test_system.py           Runs the detector over the data folders and writes results_*.txt
scripts/check_output_format.py   Validates a results file against the required format
setup_git.sh, submit.sh  One-time setup + commit/push helper ("backup button")
```

## The task in one paragraph

Implement three interpretable rules (metadata, color histogram, template matching)
that combine into a 0-100 confidence score. Run your system on `modified_images/`
and `random/` and save the full output as `results_v1.txt`. In Phase 2, run on
`hard/`, diagnose a systematic failure, add a **Rule 4**, and save
`results_v1_hard.txt` and `results_v2.txt`. Full instructions are in the Codio guide
and in the assignment PDF in UBLearns.

## Running

```bash
# Phase 1 (easy + random) -> results_v1.txt
python3 test_system.py --modified --random --output results_v1.txt

# Phase 1 on hard cases -> results_v1_hard.txt
python3 test_system.py --hard --output results_v1_hard.txt

# Phase 2 (everything) -> results_v2.txt
python3 test_system.py --modified --hard --random --rules-v2 --output results_v2.txt

# Validate any results file against the required format:
python3 scripts/check_output_format.py results_v1.txt
```

The data folders are resolved from a sibling clone of `EAS510_Assignment1`.
If your data is elsewhere, pass `--data-dir /path/to/EAS510_Assignment1`.

## Output format (do not alter)

```
Processing: modified_image_01.jpg
Rule 1 (Metadata): FIRED - Size ratio 0.85 -> 20/30 points
Rule 2 (Histogram): FIRED - Correlation 0.92 -> 25/30 points
Rule 3 (Template): FIRED - Match score 0.76 -> 30/40 points
Final Score: 75/100 -> MATCH to original_03.jpg
```

## Backup doctrine

Your Codio box can be reset at any time. **Your fork on GitHub is the only safe
copy.** After every milestone run `./submit.sh "describe what you did"`. A box
restart never touches GitHub.

## Observed weakness in V1: what failed and why

V1 rejected all 10 resize cases (v3) and all 10 crop-and-resize cases (v6).
For example, `original_00__resize_scale114__compress__q45__v3.jpg` scored
26/100, and `original_00__crop_keep60__resized__q45__v6.jpg` scored 23/100.
Resizing changed the scale of the image content, so the single-scale template
rule failed. Metadata also lost its supporting template evidence, leaving
histogram points alone below the matching threshold.

## Design decision for V2: what Rule 4 is and why you chose it

Rule 4 tries template matching at several sizes in both directions to handle
enlarged and reduced content. Scale-search matches require correlation of at
least 0.85 and some color agreement to reduce accidental matches. Strong
same-scale matches pass directly. The weights are 15/15/20/50, keeping the
total at 100 while allowing Rule 4 to rescue a match when the older rules fail.

## Effect of the change: accuracy before/after on easy vs hard

Easy accuracy stayed at 60/60 (100%). Hard accuracy rose from 31/60 (51.7%)
to 51/60 (85%), recovering all 20 resize-related failures. The two examples
above became correct matches at 63/100 and 62/100. All 15 unrelated images
were rejected at 0/100 in both versions.

## Trade-offs: what new costs or risks did Rule 4 introduce

Searching several sizes takes more time and creates more opportunities for
accidental matches. The initial search falsely accepted two unrelated images;
the color check removed those errors on this dataset. That check could also
reject genuine matches with large color changes and resizing. V2 still misses
nine rotated images, and its improvement is measured only on the supplied data.
